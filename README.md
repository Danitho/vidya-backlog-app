### Todo-list:
* -[ ] Allow user to update a row
* -[ ] Allow user to delete a row
* -[ ] Fix write function so you can insert null in rating into the db (probably add another constructor?) 
* -[ ] Add some sort of welcome page when user opens the application (edit the default panel in Main?)'
* -[ ] Add logo?
* -[ ] Add simple stats in the Stats page (graphics later on)
* -[ ] Implement and add some options in the Options page (export your list for example)
* -[ ] Add images to each game (Maybe an API?)
* -[ ] Add button in My List that allows the user to toggle between list view and image view
* -[ ] Add a color to status column depending on the status?

To be continued...
